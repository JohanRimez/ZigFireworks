ZigBlobs
Johan Rimez - 2024

This is an open source project featuring:
* ZIG programming language (www.ziglang.org)
* SDL2 - Simple DirectMedia Layer (www.libsdl.org)

This program is intended to demonstrate graphics programming for a simple but fully working coding example using ZIG & SDL.

The original idea for the program came from this coding tutorial:

The Coding Train - Coding challenge #27 - Fireworks
https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/27-fireworks

USAGE:

<any key> quits the application

COMPILING:

The interested coders would immediate find out that the native system wherefor this application is developed, is WindowsOS.
They are invited to adapt the necessary include links (headers & libraries) to their specific installation.
For WindowOS: running the executable works best with the SDL2.dll library in the same directory as the executable.
For Linux: package "libsdl2-dev" should already be installed as a prerequisite.

REMARK:

The main calculation loop is done with thread pool (just as an exercise).

Kind regards
Johan*
